# Channel flow around a cylinder at Mach 2
#
# Boundary conditions are supersonic Mach 2 inflow at the left portion of the domain
# and supersonic outflow at the right portion of the domain. The top and bottom of the
# channel as well as the cylinder are treated as Euler slip wall boundaries.
# This flow results in strong shock refletions / interactions as well as Kelvin-Helmholtz
# instabilities at later times as two Mach stems form above and below the cylinder.

# Keywords: supersonic flow, shock capturing, AMR, unstructured curved mesh,
